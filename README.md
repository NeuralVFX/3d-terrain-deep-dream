# 3d-terrain-deep-dream
Pytorch implementation of deep-dreaming based on [Neural 3D Mesh Renderer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07566.pdf)

I just started this, so it's not ready to clone yet, however maybe in a couple days.

I've tested this using the [GeoPose3k Dataset](http://cphoto.fit.vutbr.cz/geoPose3K/).

# Code usage
Usage instructions found here: [user manual page](USAGE.md).

## Example Output
### GeoPose3k Bedroom Dataset
